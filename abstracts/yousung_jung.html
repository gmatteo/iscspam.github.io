  <h2>Inorganic Crystal Structure Generation and Synthetic Predictions Enabled by AI</h2>
  Materials informatics utilizes data to establish relationships between the
  structures and properties of materials, enabling the exploration of the
  vastness of the materials space through the use of models. Trained on diverse
  datasets, the generative models can unlock the potential for predicting novel
  materials with tailored properties. However, while the key advantage of
  generative models is a potential to produce novel materials, often times they
  may be “too novel” and cannot be synthesized. In order to minimize the time
  and resources for experimental synthesis attempts, models that can predict the
  synthesizability (and, if synthesizable, synthesis recipes as well) would be
  immensely helpful.
  <br>
  Thus, in this talk, I will delve into two important aspects of materials
  design: generation and synthesis prediction based on data and machine
  learning. I will also present the results of using large language models as
  strong baseline for synthesizability predictions and precursor selection
  problems.
