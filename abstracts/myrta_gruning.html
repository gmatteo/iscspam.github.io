  <h2>Nonlinear Optics in Advanced Materials from First Principles</h2>
  In the past decades, many-body approaches based on the GW approximation and
  the Bethe-Salpeter equation have become state-of-the-art for calculating
  optical absorption in solids and nanostructures. In this talk, I will present a
  real-time approach derived from the non-equilibrium Green's function, that
  allows extending the GW+BSE approach beyond the linear regime [1,2]. Using this
  approach, I will address the importance of many-body effects and in particular
  of excitonic effects for nonlinear optical properties [3]. For example, I will
  look at the case of single-layer monochalcogenide whose strong Second Harmonic
  Generation cannot be reproduced within the independent-particle
  approximation [4]. I will then showcase a few applications to e.g. sum of
  frequency generation in 2D materials.  In the second part of the talk, I will
  address the computational cost of these approaches and so discuss the
  possibility of a real-time approach based on time-dependent density-functional
  theory, that can describe excitonic effects [5] or of alternatives to the
  real-time approach [6].
