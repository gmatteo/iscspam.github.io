  <h2>Machine Learning Tools with Domain Knowledge to Accelerate the Development of Perovskite Solar Cells</h2>
  The carbon-neutral goal puts a time-sensitive requirement for the R&D of
  renewable energy materials, that is to rapidly develop high-performance,
  low-cost new materials and achieve industrial application in a relative short
  timeframe. For solar PV, the global deployment needs to increase nearly
  70-fold next 30 years. The pressure is imminent for accelerating the R&D of
  new PV materials. Recently, machine learning is expected to accelerate the
  research of emerging PV technology, such as, perovskite solar cells. This work
  focuses on machine learning tools that incorporate domain knowledge for
  perovskite solar cells.
  <br>
  As an example, we discuss three important R&D tasks: autonomous optimization
  of fabrication process, high-throughput analysis of spectral characterization
  data, and intelligent screening of surface passivation materials. Firstly,
  regarding the high-dimensional process optimization, Bayesian optimization can
  quickly establish the process-performance correlation.  We achieve an
  optimization of six process parameters simultaneously and find the optimal
  process condition for spray coating of perovskite thin films. Secondly, for
  the spectral characterization of perovskite thin films, machine learning has a
  common challenge of data scarcity in experiments. Transfer learning could
  learn domain physics based on theoretical simulations. After training with
  simulated data, only a small amount of experimental data is needed in the
  secondary training to achieve high prediction accuracy. We demonstrate this
  concept from the reflection/transmission spectra, and extract the thin film
  thickness accurately. Finally, we tackle the materials screening challenges of
  surface passivation materials for perovskites. By converting a molecule
  structure to a set of molecular descriptors, machine learning regression model
  can establish the relationship between the molecular characteristics and
  device performance.  We are then able to identify a few high-quality organic
  molecules to achieve higher device efficiency. In short, these proposed
  applications combine machine learning methods with domain knowledge and
  experience related to photovoltaic materials. To conclude, we will have an
  open discussion on the perspective of the generative AI tools (e.g., GPT) for
  materials science research.
