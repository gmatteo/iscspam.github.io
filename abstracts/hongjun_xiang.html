  <h2>Machine Learning Approaches in Property Analysis and Simulation Package for Materials (PASP)</h2>
  We have developed a software package, namely, PASP (Property Analysis and
  Simulation Package for materials), to analyze the structural, electronic,
  magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of complex condensed matter systems.
  Our package integrates several functionalities including group theory
  analysis, global structure searching methods, tight-binding approach,
  effective Hamiltonian methods, Monte Carlo simulation, spin-lattice dynamic
  simulation methods, and machine learning approaches.
  <br>
  In this talk, I will mainly focus on the implemented machine learning
  approaches in PASP. In particular, I will discuss our newly developed machine
  learning potential approach for magnetic systems, the transferable equivariant
  graph neural networks for the electronic Hamiltonians of molecules and solids,
  and the universal machine learning electronic Hamiltonian for any materials.
  The applications of these machine learning approaches to two-dimensional
  magnets, electron phonon coupling related phenomena, and high-throughput
  search of new functional materials will be presented as well.
