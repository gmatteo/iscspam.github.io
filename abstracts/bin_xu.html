  <h2>Ab Initio Thermoelectric Properties Based on Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
  The Seebeck coefficient is one of the key ingredients in thermoelectric
  properties, and it is often calculated based simply on the electronic band
  structure, within the frame of Boltzmann's transport theory and the constant
  relaxation time approximation. Despite the simplicity and popularity of this
  approximation, its validity is not fully justified even in lightly doped
  semiconductors, and it breaks down completely in metals. On the other hand,
  more sophisticated first-principles approaches are available but require the
  computation of the full electron-phonon coupling. In this talk, I will discuss
  three cases comparing these two approaches: 1) Non-magnetic elemental metals
  viz., Li, Na, K, Cu, Ag, Au and Pt, some of which exhibit abnormal sign of the
  Seebeck coefficient [1]; 2) 3d ferromagnetic metals, viz. Fe, Co and Ni, whose
  transport properties are challenging to compute [2]; 3) Electron-dope BaTiO3,
  in which a critical enhancement of resistivity and thermopower can occur in
  the vicinity of the polar-to-nonpolar transition [3].
