  <h2>MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic materials design</h2>
  The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in
  driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and
  carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design
  by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property
  constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low
  success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited
  set of property constraints. MatterGen is a model that generates stable,
  diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be
  fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property
  constraints. We introduce a new diffusion-based generative process that
  produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types, coordinates,
  and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to enable
  fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labelled dataset.
  Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen are more
  than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times closer to
  the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates
  stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as
  mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate
  multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have
  both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain
  risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of
  MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a
  universal generative model for materials design.
