  <h2>First-Principles Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  First-principles methods based on density functional theory (DFT) have become
  indispensable to the study of physics, chemistry, materials science, etc., but
  are bottlenecked by the efficiency-accuracy dilemma. The marriage of
  first-principles methods and artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to
  revolutionize the field.
  <br>
  In this talk, I will review an emerging interdisciplinary field of
  first-principles AI, which applies state-of-the-art AI techniques to help
  solve bottleneck problems of first-principles computation. In particular, I
  will introduce our recent works on developing a deep neural network framework
  to learn the dependence of DFT Hamiltonian (DeepH) on the atomic structure
  [1-3]. The neural network models are trained by DFT data on small structures
  and then applied to study unseen material structures without invoking
  sophisticated DFT computation, making efficient and accurate study of
  large-scale materials feasible. This development in combination with recent
  advances of deep-learning electronic structure calculations open the door for
  neural-network DFT calculations [4-10]. Very likely, in the near future most
  first-principles computation will be based on neural networks, so will
  materials discovery and design.
