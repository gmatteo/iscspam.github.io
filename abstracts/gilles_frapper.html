    <h2>Emergence of Polynitrogen Networks in M-N Phases under Pressure:
      En Route to High-Energy Density Materials</h2>
    Dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is the most abundant element on Earth and is mostly
    unreactive at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. This is mainly due to
    its strong triple bond. Hypothetical molecules containing nitrogen atoms
    connected by unstable single or double bonds have been proposed to decompose to
    very stable N<sub>2</sub> molecules with the release of large amounts of energy.
    Consequently, the quest for materials with a high nitrogen content is still
    regarded as a "holy grail" in science, due to their chemical interest and
    potential as environmentally friendly high-energy density materials (HEDMs).
    Unfortunately, neutral polynitrogen compounds are expected to have a small
    energy barrier toward decomposition, such as the long-sought but still
    unobtained tetrahedrane N4. To overcome these kinetic and thermodynamic issues,
    we and others proposed that mixing an electropositive element M or molecular
    ionic species with nitrogen may lead to stable solid-state
    M<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> compounds where the polynitrogen anionic
    (N)<sub>y</sub><sup>q-</sup> nets would be stabilized by a sea of cations. An
    alternative approach to the synthesis of "polymerised nitrogen" is the
    modulation of pressure, which can overcome the high kinetic barriers encountered
    in such processes and thermodynamically stabilise the M<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>
    products, as illustrated in Figure 1. The resulting high-pressure compound can
    then be recovered to ambient conditions.

    This talk will present a brief overview of the evolutionary (genetic) algorithm,
    with a particular focus on its contribution to the field of crystal structure
    prediction [1,2]. Here, the global optimiser is combined with a first-principles
    local optimiser, creating a powerful tool for scanning the energy landscape. The
    DFT calculations are performed at the PBE, SCAN or HSE06 levels (+vdW
    corrections), depending on the property being evaluated. These include crystal
    structure, energy, phonons, AIMD, energy gap, bands, DOS, COHP, COBI, and so
    forth.

    Molecular units such as N<sub>2</sub><sup>q-</sup> dumbbells,
    cyclo-N<sub>5</sub>- pentazolate, 6-ring N<sub>6</sub><sup>q-</sup>, polymeric infinite chains, and
    2D/3D polynitrogen nets have been identified on binary polynitrogen-based
    compounds M<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> (M=Mg [3], Ba [4], Sn [5] Xe [6],
    transition metals [7], Pb…) that are dynamically and thermodynamically stable on
    their respective potential energy surfaces at a given pressure. Finally, the
    electronic and detonation properties of the in silico predicted metastable
    compounds but dynamically and thermally stable at ambient conditions will be
    presented. Will our results lead to attempts at synthesis? That is one of the
    aims of our work in the field of 'Computational Materials Discovery', supported
    by GENCI (IDRIS, TGCC), ANR, Feder Nouvelle Aquitaine, CNRS, the EUR Intree and
    UPsquared programs of Poitiers University
