  <h2>Design of Hybrid Metal Halides with Specific Crystal Structures and Photoluminescence Properties</h2>
  The discovery of new materials with specific properties is a complex task due
  to the drastic effects that very slight modifications on the synthesis of
  materials can have on the crystal structures and the resulting properties.
  Machine learning can be a very useful tool in such situations and can
  drastically accelerate the discovery of new functional materials as well as
  assist us to rationalize complex mechanisms.
  <br>
  In this presentation, the accelerated discovery of new hybrid metal halides by
  machine learning will be presented. These materials have recently shown a
  great potential in optoelectronic applications. For this reason, many research
  groups are currently exploring this chemical system to discover new low
  dimensional hybrid metal halides of perovskite types. However, discovering
  such materials is challenging as the necessary structure determination by
  X-ray diffraction is time consuming and non-perovskite compounds are very
  often synthesized. In this presentation, three approaches will be introduced
  which guided us towards the synthesis of new hybrid metal halides of specific
  properties or structures: (i) the use of active learning to target white
  phosphors with specific correlated color temperatures and optimal color
  rendering index for solid-state lighting [1], (ii) the use of deep learning to
  automatically identify hybrid perovskites from powder X-ray diffraction
  patterns [2], and (iii) the use of molecular descriptors to identify organic
  amines with high probability to lead to the synthesis of hybrid
  perovskites [3].
