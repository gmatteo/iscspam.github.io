  <h2>Design of Bulk Nanostructured Eutectic High Entropy Alloy and Its Application for Electrocatalysis</h2>
  Eutectics in high entropy alloys (HEAs) have shown excellent properties and
  promising applications with nano lamellar structure. With empirical rules,
  various of eutectic high entropy alloys (EHEAs) have been proposed. The
  current design strategies shed light on the formation of eutectics in HEAs,
  but they are incapable of confirming multiple variables quantitatively in the
  selection of a specific system. We uncovered the eutectic formation in the
  multi-principal element systems via data mining with machine learning (ML),
  where the critical elements and strongly associated elements were
  discovered [1]. Taking the Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system as an example, Al is confirmed
  to be the critical element for the eutectic formation and Cr is the strongly
  associated element with Al, Ni, Co, Fe. After that minor additions with
  comparably large solid solubility can be considered overall.

  The EHEA with nano lamellar structure provide a chance for the development of
  mechanically robust and electrochemically active high-performance electrodes
  for the electrocatalytic process. Furthermore, the HEAs are rising with
  excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni high entropy
  alloy electrode with hierarchically porous structure (PHEA) was designed and
  fabricated via the selective etching of a eutectic two-phase microstructure
  [2]. Compared with commercial nickel foam (NF) as an electrocatalyst
  substrate, PHEA possessed better mechanical robustness, larger specific
  surface area, more favorable electrocatalytic activity and long-term
  stability. Electrochemical measurements showed that the PHEA electrode
  modified with trace-noble-metal-doped-LDH exhibited excellent catalytic
  activity and stability, with overpotentials of 21 and 227 mV at a current
  density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen
  evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Surprisingly, long-term stability at
  an ultrahigh industrial-level current density (~1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>) was
  observed when employing the bifunctional LDH@PHEA electrode assembly in an
  overall water splitting device. This work explored the advantages and
  application of PHEA as a versatile electrocatalyst substrate, providing new
  insights and approaches for designing and constructing robust porous
  electrodes via surface modification towards efficient hydrogen generation.
