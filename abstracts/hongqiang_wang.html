  <h2>Surface and Grain Boundaries Engineering in Pervokskite Solar Cells via Laser Generated Nano-Colloids</h2>
  
  <br>
  Planar optoelectronics have achieved tremendous success in fields including
  photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, however, interface loss
  therein always acts as the dominate factor for the limitation of device
  performance. We herein demonstrate the technological superiority of laser
  processing of colloids on generating various nanocrystals in different solvents
  to address the interfacial loss of the optoelectronic films. Exemplified by the
  hybrid perovskite solar cells, we show that the unique application of the laser
  processing of colloids on improving the extraction of the photogenerated charge
  carriers at grain boundaries of perovskite active layer and decreasing the
  energy barrier at interfaces between perovskite and charge transporting layer.
  In a simple device with regular planar configuration, formamidinium lead
  iodide-based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum efficiencies over 25%. In
  addition, the PSCs based on the mixed-cation perovskite deliver more than 10000
  hours of moisture stability as well as 1000 hours of thermal stability. We thus
  believe that the interfacial embedding of laser generated colloids will have
  important applications in optoelectronic applications.
