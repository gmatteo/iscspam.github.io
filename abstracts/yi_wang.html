  <h2>Smart Design High-Entropy Materials through the Hybrid Knowledge-Assisted Data-Driven Machine Learning</h2>
  Lattice engineering and distortion have been considered one kind of effective
  strategies discovering advanced materials.  The instinct chemical flexibility
  of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) motivate/accelerate to tailor the target
  properties through phase transformations and lattice distortion.  Here, a
  hybrid knowledge-assisted data-driven machine learning (ML) strategy is
  utilized to discover the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>-type HEOs with low thermal conductivity (洧랜)
  through 17 rare-earth (RE = Sc, Y, La ~ Lu) solutes optimized A-site.  A
  designing routine integrating the ML and high throughput first-principles has
  been proposed to predict the key physical parameter (KPPs) correlated to the
  targeted 洧랜 of advanced HEOs.  Among the smart-designed 6188 (5RE0.2)<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
  HEOs, the best candidates are addressed and validated by the principles of
  severe lattice distortion and local phase transformation, which effectively
  reduce 洧랜 by the strong multi-phonon scattering and weak interatomic
  interactions.  Particularly,
  (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Y<sub>0.2</sub>La<sub>0.2</sub>Ce<sub>0.2</sub>Pr<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
  with predicted 洧랜 below 1.59 Wm<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> is selected to be
  verified, which match well with the experimental 洧랜= 1.69 Wm<sup>-1</sup>
  K<sup>-1</sup> at 300K and could be further decreased to 0.14 Wm<sup>-1</sup>
  K<sup>-1</sup> at 1473K.  Moreover, the coupling effects of lattice vibrations
  and charges on heat transfer are revealed by the cross-validations of various
  models, indicating that the weak bonds with low electronegativity and few
  bonding charge density and the lattice distortion (r<sup>*</sup>) identified by cation
  radius ratio (r<sub>A</sub>/r<sub>B</sub>) should be the KPPs to decrease 洧랜 
  efficiently.  This work supports an intelligent designing strategy with
  limited atomic and electronic KPPs to accelerate the development of advanced
  multi-component HEOs with properties/performance at multi-scales.
