  <h2>Advancing Solid Interface and Lubricants by First Principles Material Design</h2>
  Friction and wear are common phenomena that impact all applications where
  moving components are in contact, from micro-electromechanical systems to wind
  turbines, and result in massive economic and environmental costs. By advancing
  tribological systems impressive energy savings, and consequent reduction of
  CO2 emissions, can be obtained. However, optimizing materials to red is
  challenging because their performances are ruled by molecular-level processes
  that occur at the buried interface, which are extremely difficult to monitor
  by experiments. Simulations can play a decisive role here, in particular those
  based on quantum mechanics, which is essential to accurately describe
  materials in conditions of enhanced reactivity as those imposed by the
  mechanical stresses applied.
  <br>
  I will present the results of ab initio and machine learnig molecular dynamics
  simulations that show how slippery layered materials can be synthesized at the
  tribological interface  thanks to tribochemical reactions. In particular, I
  will show that selenide layers can be formed by sprinkling Se nanopowders onto
  sliding contacts [1] and graphene can be obtained by the
  tribologically-induced polymerization of aromatic molecules [2]. Finally, I
  will discuss the potentiality of machine-learning molecular dynamics to design
  self-assembled monolayers as friction modifiers [3].  In the second part of
  the talk I will present TribChem, a software for the high-throughput study of
  solid interfaces [4], and the results that were obtained for pristine,
  chemically modified metal-metal, and metal-diamond interfaces [5,6,7].
