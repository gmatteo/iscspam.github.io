  <h2>Intelligent Design of Electron-Rich Materials for Catalysis and Energy Applications</h2>
  Electron-rich intermetallic compounds, such as electrides and MAX/MAB phases,
  possess several key characteristics including low work function, strong
  electron-donating ability, and strong inert bonding force. These compounds
  have shown great potential in various catalytic reactions, such as ammonia
  synthesis, ammonia decomposition, CO2 hydrogenation, and alkali metal ion
  batteries. As a result, they have attracted significant research interest.
  However, electron-rich materials exhibit wide compositional variation and
  diverse structures, which presents a challenge in efficiently designing new
  multi-element compounds of this type.
  <br>
  Conventional approaches to material design and development, which rely on
  trial and error based on experience and experiments, are inefficient and
  time-consuming. These methods fall short of meeting the urgent demands for new
  electron-rich materials in core applications. To address this issue, recent
  exploratory studies have focused on employing materials genetic engineering
  techniques, such as high-throughput computational screening, structure
  prediction, and machine learning, to design and develop novel electron-rich
  materials more efficiently. By using high-throughput computational screening,
  researchers can rapidly evaluate a large number of potential compound
  configurations and identify promising candidates for further investigation
  (Figure 1). Structure prediction techniques help in predicting the atomic
  arrangements and crystal structures of these compounds. Additionally, machine
  learning algorithms can be employed to analyze the vast amount of existing
  data and establish relationships between material properties and composition,
  aiding in the identification of optimal chemical combinations for targeted
  properties. The speaker will present the results of recent research efforts
  that utilize these materials genetic engineering methods for the design and
  development of novel electron-rich materials. These advancements offer a
  promising avenue for accelerating the discovery process and addressing the
  urgent need for efficient design approaches in this field.
