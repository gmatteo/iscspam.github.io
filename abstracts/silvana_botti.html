  <h2>Machine-Learning-Assisted Design of Materials for Energy Applications</h2>
  In this presentation, we explore the utilization of supercomputers to design
  new functional materials with a focus on energy applications. The combination
  of high throughput techniques and rapidly advancing supercomputers enables the
  automatic screening of vast numbers of hypothetical materials, providing
  solutions to current technological challenges. Moreover, the integration of
  machine learning methods with density-functional theory offers a powerful
  approach to accelerate materials discovery. We summarize our recent efforts in
  the discovery, characterization, and understanding of inorganic compounds
  using these innovative approaches, with a specific emphasis on materials for
  photovoltaics.

  While characterizing the electronic properties of crystalline bulk materials
  is crucial, it may not be sufficient when considering electronic devices.
  Interfaces, such as those found in transistors, light-emitting diodes, and
  solar cells, play a pivotal role in exploiting quantum processes involving
  electrons in tailored multilayers. The ability to shape potential gradients at
  interfaces opens up opportunities for electron manipulation and the
  development of new functionalities. However, designing interfaces and gaining
  a deep understanding of their properties present challenges that exceed the
  current state of the art. We discuss recent advancements in this direction.
