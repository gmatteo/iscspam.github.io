  <h2>From Structure to Function: Designing Materials with Desired Properties through Structure-Property Insights</h2>
  Computational materials design has emerged as a pivotal approach for
  accelerating the development of new materials, addressing both current and
  future technological challenges. By understanding the fundamental nature of
  structure-property relationships, we can develop materials that combine all
  desirable features while avoiding unwanted ones.
  <br>
  In this talk, I will focus on two classes of materials: organic-inorganic
  halide perovskites and molecular crystals. Halide perovskites have garnered
  significant attention in recent years due to their exceptional photovoltaic
  performance, attributed to properties such as tunable band gaps, low exciton
  binding energy, and long charge carrier recombination lifetimes. Despite their
  high power conversion efficiency, questions remain regarding their structural,
  electronic and optical properties, particularly concerning long-term
  stability. Through theoretical analyses, we propose design principles aimed at
  synthesizing stable halide perovskites, making them promising candidates for
  solar cell applications [1-3].
  <br>
  Similarly, molecular crystals are extensively used as active pharmaceutical
  ingredients and in other sectors, such as food, agriculture, and polymers. A
  major challenge in these industries, particularly pharmaceuticals, is the
  existence of multiple crystal forms (polymorphs) for the same compound. The
  physico-chemical properties, including thermal stability, solubility and
  dissolution rate, can dramatically vary between polymorphs, significatnly
  impacting the drug efficacy. Thus, accurately predicting the correct polymorph
  of a compound is a critical goal.
  <br>
  THz spectroscopy is valuable in this endeavor, as each polymorph's unique
  spectral fingerprint aids in their identification. However, deciphering the
  vibrational spectra of molecular crystals poses a significant challenge.
  Assigning peaks to specific vibrational modes typically requires experience
  and chemical intuition, but the complexity of these spectra often makes such
  assignments impractical.  Quantum chemistry methods have proven reliable in
  accurately simulating the vibrational spectra.
  <br>
  In this context, I will introduce TheSeuSS, an automated computational
  platform that efficiently simulates IR, Raman and THz spectra for both
  periodic and non-periodic systems at DFT and DFTB levels of theory [4].
  TheSeuSS also provides an accurate description of intermolecular forces,
  crucial for molecular crystals as their molecules are held together by weak
  intermolecular forces. Our user-friendly platform allows users with varying
  expertise to perform THz spectra simulations, facilitating efficient and
  accurate high-throughput screening of multiple polymorphs, significantly
  contributing to the broader efforts in crystal structure prediction studies.
  By drawing comparisons and highlighting the synergies between these two areas
  of research, we demonstrate how a fundamental understanding of
  structure-property relationships can lead to innovative design principles,
  tailored for specific applications.
