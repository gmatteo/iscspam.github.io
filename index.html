The International Symposium on Computational Structure Prediction and Advanced Materials (ISCSP&AM) is
a science and technical congregation where the latest theoretical and experimental advances in new material
discovery will be presented and discussed. The topics to be covered by the symposium include
the new developments of computational structure prediction methods and the applications of advanced computational
methods on the discovery of electrides, transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), superconductors and other electronic materials.
