    <br>
    The International Symposium on Computational Structure Prediction and Advanced Materials
    (ISCSP&AM) is a science and technical congregation where the latest theoretical and
    experimental advances in new material discovery will be presented and discussed.
    The topics to be covered by the symposium include the new developments of computational
    structure prediction methods and the applications of advanced computational
    methods on the discovery of electrides, transparent conducting oxides (TCOs),
    superconductors and other electronic materials.
